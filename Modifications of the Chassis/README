In this file, you will see photos of the changes our team made to the car, The first photo that shows the chassis with some borders colored in black. 
This photo means the parts that we cut off the car that are the sides so we can make a mechanism so the 2 backwheels only use one DC motor.
Then we cut the half of the car that is also colored in black. We cut that so the car length reduces 4 cm aprox.

Then we insert 2 plates underneath the chassis, which are the 2 sides that we cut. We do this so that the 2 halves of the chassis that we cut, come back together.
