NPC2 is a robotics team from Caracas, Venezuela nationally representing Colegio Jefferson in the World Robotics Olimpiad. We have a car named Crazy Diamond that has one motor, one servomotor, one PixyCam2, two ultrasonic sensors, one Arduino R4, one voltage regulator, one H bridge, one 7.6 v battery, and an ackerman sterring wheel.

We are competing in the future engineers category of the W.R.O.
The future engineers category consist in 3 mayor challenges:
The first challenge consist that the car has to do 3 complete laps in the track for then stop in the same place the car started.
The second challenge consist that the car will has to do laps but in these case there are some obstacles that depending on the color, the car will have to go left or right.
The last challenge consist that the car will started in a parking slot and it has to do the second challenge again, but in this case  the car will have to stop in the parking slot in parallel.

For this the first thing we do, was to organize different things for example the materials, the chasis we will use, and in what microcontroller we will program.
After a long period of discussion we have already the different materials we will use that are:
1. The microcontroller that we used is the Arduino R4 WIFI. The Arduino UNO R4 WIFI is an upgraded version of the Arduino UNO, featuring Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity (in this case, due to the competition the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity is disable). It’s built around the Renesas RA4M1 microcontroller, which is a 32-bit ARM Cortex-M4 running at 48 MHz, offering significantly more power than the previous 8-bit ATmega328P in the UNO R3. Also this Arduino just needs 5V to start working and in short words, this will be the brain of the car. The Arduino R4 Wi-Fi has 14 digital pins and 6 analogs, so this make it perfect for us to works. Besides is very easy to code in it as it use a subdivision of C++ called Arduino C++.
