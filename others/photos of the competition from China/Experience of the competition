In our opinion, the competition was a truly wonderful event. We learned so many new things and made friends from different countries.
Another highlight we want to mention is the progress we made with our car, Crazy Diamond. All our hard work paid off, as we proudly achieved first place.
We are deeply grateful to WRO China for the invitation, and to our coach for giving us this incredible opportunity.
Thank you very much :).
